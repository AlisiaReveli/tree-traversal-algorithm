After reading this blog: https://towardsdatascience.com/4-types-of-tree-traversal-algorithms-d56328450846 ,
I decided to create a representation of trees in javascript.
We have two kind of tree traversal algorithms:
```
  BFS(breadth first search): LevelOrder
  DFS(depth first search) : Inorder,Preorder,Postorder. 
```
  
  Time complexity of these algorithms is O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
  In my examples I've been using those algorithms for searching,finding the sum and minimum of nodes in a binary tree.
